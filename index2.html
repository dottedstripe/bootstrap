                <blockquote>
                “Time management” is the process of organizing and planning
            how to divide your time between specific activities. Good time management enables
            you to work smarter – not harder – so that you get more done in less time, even
            when time is tight and pressures are high.
            Failing to manage your time damages your effectiveness and causes stress.
                </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p> It seems that there is never enough time in the day. But, since we all get the same 24 hours,
            why is it that some people achieve so much more with their time than others? The answer lies in good time management.

                <h2>What Is “Time Management?”</h2>
                <p>
                    “Time management” refers to the way that you organize and plan how long you spend on specific activities.

                    It may seem counter-intuitive to dedicate precious time to learning about time management,
                    instead of using it to get on with your work, but the benefits are enormous:

                    <li>Greater productivity and efficiency.</li>
                    <li>A better professional reputation.</li>
                    <li>Less stress.</li>
                    <li>Increased opportunities for advancement.</li>

                <p>So many of us are guilty of losing focus. Constantly checking emails as they roll in,
                    reading all the news websites, instant messaging about... well everything, a quick facebook
                    check that turns into a high school crush stalking session.
                    So how do you fix it?
                    The focus booster desktop app enables you to use the pomodoro technique without the need to
                    have your browser open, so you can't be distracted!
                    Plus all your sessions are recorded back to the web app, so you have a complete record of where
                    all your time goes, you can even create reports and invoices from it.

                        <h2>Simple Ways to Add 2 Hours More to Your Day</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Plan your days.
                                <p>Chris Bailey, author of The Productivity Project, spent a year test-driving productivity techniques on his blog, A Life of Productivity. He says that the best tactic he’s found for working intentionally is what he calls the Rule of 3. “At the start of the day, before you start working, you simply step back from your work and ask yourself: by the time the day is done, what three main things will I want to have accomplished?” Figuring out what’s most important keeps you from losing hours as you blindly respond to whatever comes in. It also encourages investing time in high-yield activities such as mentoring new employees.
                                By thinking through your days, you can also match the right kind of activity to the right time. Deep focused work is best done when you have a lot of energy. “People who are high achievers are ruthless schedulers,” says Wendy Murphy, an assistant professor at Babson College who teaches organizational behavior and management. “When are you most able to focus? Schedule the type of work you need to do during the times you have the most energy to do it.”
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Manage distractions.
                                <p>Between social media alerts, emails, and drive-by visits, people can be distracted dozens or more times per day. Since one study found that people take 25 minutes to resume interrupted tasks (after dabbling, on average, in more than 2 other “work spheres” in the meantime), pushing distractions to predictable times can easily save hours. “Schedule time in your calendar for email/social media or when you will have interruptions,” suggests Murphy. “For example, professors have ‘office hours’ when they expect to be regularly interrupted by students. Is there a time of day when you are regularly interrupted? Plan for it.”
                                </p>

                                  </li>
                                <p>
                                    You might also consider more radical solutions. One study found that people spend 47% of their time on the internet procrastinating (indeed, you may be procrastinating now!) That’s why Bailey says that “Whenever I hunker down to work on something important, I almost always disconnect from the internet.”
                                </p>
                            <li>Don’t do what others can do (or that doesn’t need to be done).
                                <p>
                                    If you’re in upper management, you can easily spend 50% of your day in meetings, which comes out to 4 (or more) hours a day. If 25% of those meetings didn’t need to happen—a conservative figure based on surveys, and how much people despise meetings generally—killing them would buy you an hour per day right there.
                                    The problem is that it’s hard to rescue the time once a meeting starts, and many people are so busy going from meeting to meeting that they don’t triage their schedules ahead of time. The solution is getting in the habit, on Friday afternoons, of looking at your calendar for the next week and asking what can be skipped or killed. Five minutes can buy back hours.
                                </p>
                             <li>Change your schedule.
                                <p>
                                    Chances are, the reason you want more hours in your day is that you’re too busy with work and family obligations to tackle your personal priorities. But most people, even busy professionals, have leisure time. The problem is that much of it occurs late at night when people are too tired to do anything but watch TV. The solution? Go to bed earlier, and wake up earlier. Most people feel more productive in the morning, so turning the TV off earlier turns unproductive evening hours into productive morning hours. Rather than spend an additional 90 minutes puttering around the house or watching Netflix at night, you wake up at 5:00 a.m. instead of 6:30 a.m. and have 30 minutes to exercise and an hour to work on your novel. Wake up early on weekends and you’ll add even more productive time to your days.

                                </p>

                            </li>
                            <li>Telecommute.
                                <p>
                                    To be sure, even in most information jobs, working from home daily won’t fly. But once or twice a week buys back massive time on those days. It’s not just the 50 minutes of average daily commuting telecommuters save on the days they work from home. Much of the time people clock getting ready in the morning is about getting out the door; about half of the 45 minutes the average person spends daily on personal care could be saved. Settling in at work takes time, as does going to a coffee shop on the way in or to a cafeteria or restaurant for lunch. Many people make stops on the drive home that may not be necessary. Chop the 45 minutes the average person spends daily on “purchasing goods and services” in half and you’re close to the 2-hour mark already, to say nothing of reduced interruptions.
                                </p>
